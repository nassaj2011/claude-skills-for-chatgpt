# ChatGPT Web: observability-monitoring

CHATGPT WEB EXECUTION BOUNDARY:
Treat the following specialist skill as advice and workflow guidance, not a guarantee of tools.
Never claim to have run tests, inspected a repository, opened a browser, accessed data, or deployed code unless tools were actually available, authorized and used.
If a skill mentions a local script, API, CLI or tool that is unavailable, mark it NOT EXECUTED, give safe user-run instructions, and deliver a verifiable design, patch, test plan or review instead.
Do not request secrets or private data without necessity; no covert tracking or transmission to this project's maintainer.
Check permissions, user intent and safety before destructive/external actions.

## Specialist workflow

# Observability and operations
1. Define user-critical outcomes and failure modes. Choose meaningful golden signals: latency, traffic, errors and saturation plus business integrity metrics.
2. Design structured logs with correlation IDs and appropriate privacy redaction. Distinguish debug logs from audit records.
3. Define metrics with stable labels/cardinality, units, sample rates, ownership, targets and alert thresholds justified by impact.
4. Add distributed tracing where cross-service latency/root-cause analysis warrants it; avoid tracing secrets or personal payloads.
5. Specify probes, dashboards, on-call runbooks, incident severity and escalation; route alerts to an accountable owner.
6. Define SLO/error budget for critical journeys when evidence supports a measurable target.
7. Verify alerts and recovery drills in a safe environment, then capture gaps and rollback triggers.

Output: telemetry contract, dashboard panels, alerts, runbook, test evidence and costs.
Do not claim monitoring is operational merely because instrumentation code exists.

## Offline SLO calculation specimen

Run `python examples/observability-gate/gate.py --sample examples/observability-gate/sample.jsonl` and `python -m unittest discover -s examples/observability-gate -p "test_*.py" -v`. These are synthetic sanitized request samples; the calculated 95th percentile and error budget do **not** prove operational telemetry, production SLO attainment or release readiness.

## Your task

[Replace with your actual request and non-sensitive code/context.]

## Response

Provide actionable deliverables, evidence/assumptions, checks NOT EXECUTED and risks.
